<ol>
<li>Users and visitors are to conduct themselves chiefly according to these Rules and Regulations, to Rules for Visitors of reading rooms and other specialized departments of the National Library and to follow instructions of the library staff. Main responsibility of users is to timely and properly meet their obligations towards the National Library. </li>

Prior to entering the National Library premises, they ought to switch off ring on their mobile phones or any sound made by any brought in equipment. Any part of the National Library premises should be used in accordance with its function. </li>
<li>Serious breach of the Rules and Regulations is unauthorized removal of a library unit beyond security check or an attempt to do so. The National Library deems it a theft or an attempt of such and will act to the full within its legal powers. </li>
<li>While using the National Library equipment users and visitors have to conduct themselves according to the National Library instructions. They must not interfere with the equipment and alter settings and network installation. </li>
<li>For safety reasons, cameras might monitor the premises of the National Library. When entering the library users and visitors ought to be aware that all their movements may be recorded. </li>
<li>Prior to entering areas beyond security checkpoint a user has to leave outer clothing, bags, briefcases, etc. in the cloakroom or in a locker. These lockers are not intended to house valuables and the National Library takes no responsibility for any damages. Handbags, with exception of notebooks, which may be taken to the library cannot be larger than 30x21x10 cm and could be subjected to security check. </li>

<li>When passing the security checkpoint, a user fills out a permit form entitling him to bring in his own materials or their copies (mostly books, journals, newspapers, sheet music, maps, microfilms, audio recordings or audiovisual cassettes). This permit and the materials themselves must be presented at the security checkpoint each time the user leaves or enters the library. </li>
<li>User is required to show to security personnel (or to library staff in reading rooms and other specialized areas) all library units that are to be taken out. When asked, a user is required to hand over a personal baggage for inspection by security and/or library staff. </li>
<li>The National Library may refuse to provide further services to a user who failed to meet his obligations toward the National Library until such time when he will have made amendments. </li>
<li>If a registered user suffers from a contagious disease he ought to be considerate enough and not come to the library. Before returning externally borrowed material he should disinfect it if at all possible and necessary or alert the library staff. </li>
<li>Disabled users have a right, or, as the case may be, upon the National Library staff instruction, the obligation to use services of a personal assistant. Holders of ZTP/P (identity card for disabled persons) have a right to use such service in all areas of the National Library to carry out their studies.

A ‘seeing dog’ may accompany visually disabled users. </li>
<li>User who breaches the law or these Rules and Regulations may be asked to leave the premises of the National Library. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="4"></a><br />User registration, processing and personal data protection </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Registered user is a user who has a valid library card. In order to register he has to be at least 15 years old and must have a valid ID card, passport or a driver’s license. Persons with disabilities must apprise library staff of their condition when they register. The Slavonic Library registers users according to its own regulations. </li>
<li>In order to register a person fills out a registration form and pays a registration fee (see supplement 5: Fees and Services Price List). The applicant must supply all required data clearly earmarked on the form. Providing any other information indicated on the form is purely voluntary. When registering, the applicant should acquaint himself with these Rules and Regulations. By signing the filled form, the applicant agrees with processing his personal data and security monitoring. Applicant must provide either a valid ID card, a passport or a driver’s license. Persons who fail to provide required personal data would be refused registration. The issued library card is nontransferable. </li>
<li>Unregistered user may be issued upon request one-day Admission Ticket, which would let him use reference collections in reading rooms and some in-house services. </li>
<li>Registration is valid for one year from the date of issue. Renewal is possible in the last month of its validity. A user has to present a still valid library card and either a valid ID card, a passport or a driver’s license. A user must report any change in the required data. </li>
<li>Personal data required by the National Library are treated in accordance with the Act No. 101/2000 Coll. on personal data protection and its amendments. The National Library is, in the sense of the law, an administrator of these data and as such is registered with the Office for Personal Data Protection. The National Library gathers personal data of its users chiefly for protection of its assets, statistics and discharging its responsibilities as they are stipulated in statutory regulations. The library staff process the data after the applicant has agreed with the procedure. </li>
<li>A library card is the registered user’s ID for dealing with the National Library. A user proffers it every time when entering or leaving the library premises or when he is asked to. If there are some doubts about the validity of the card, the person might be asked to show a personal ID. In case of loss or theft the user should immediately inform the library otherwise he is responsible for its misuse. There is a charge for issuing a duplicate. (See Supplement 5: Fees and Services Price List) </li>
<li>Registered user may ask in writing for termination of his library privileges and removal of his personal data from the library files. If there were no obligations toward the National Library on the user’s side the library would comply right away. In general, the personal data are removed from the library files after a user has not renewed the registration for two consecutive years and concurrently after at least one year from discharging his last obligations towards the library. </li>
<li>If there is a well grounded suspicion of criminal goings-on or of a serious breach of the Rules and Regulations on the side of a user the National Library reserves a right to temporarily withhold his card. </li>
<li>There is a charge for registration and its each renewal as stipulated in the Fees and Services Price List. </li>
</ol>

<p><br /><strong><a name="5"></a><br />General lending provisions </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lending is a contractual transaction and as such is regulated by Statutes of the Czech Republic and by these Rules and Regulations. The Slavonic Library has its own lending regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lending is based on the type of material and its physical condition. Unique and rare material, items deposited in the archival collections or those endangered by overuse are lent only for substantiated scholarly research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an item is being lent the user should inspect it and report any damages. Damage is not a general wear and tear due to handling, character and age of the particular library unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User should fill out an order slip clearly and legibly otherwise the library staff may fail to find the requested material. If there is a delay in delivery the user will be each time informed about the reasons. In one day, orders for a maximum of ten library units will be processed for one registered user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivery time or information about the delay must not exceed 48 hours (not counting days the library is closed for weekends, statutory holidays or when it is closed to the public).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a library unit is on loan to another user or is unavailable for other reasons the National Library places a hold on it upon the registered user's request. Reservations are valid for two years and are processed on the first come first serve basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User is required to return a borrowed library unit in the same condition it was lent. The user has to report to the library staff any damage, mess up or a loss immediately and make compensation to the National Library. Damage is considered to be any change in or interference with the unit (such as underlining, highlighting, notes in the margins, putting in stickers, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user is not authorized to re-lend the borrowed library unit.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="6"></a><br />In-house lending and reading rooms access </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Any user may perform an in-house loan from open access collections. The loan contract is concluded at the moment the user takes hold of the library unit of an open access collection. </li>
<li>In-house loan of a library unit, which is not in the open access collection, is granted only to a registered user. The loan contract s concluded at the moment the library staff member hands over a library unit to the user. Such lent library unit must be returned to a staff member before closing time or when it is not needed any longer. In general, in-house lent items are to be used in a particular reading room, from which they must not be removed. </li>
<li>Registration of in-house loans is carried out at a reading room service desk by filing a user’s library card together with loan slips. </li>
<li>Registered user may have a maximum of ten library units on loan and five on reserve in one reading room at one time. A library unit may be on reserve for one week from the delivery of the loan. Reservation may be renewed repeatedly subject to no other user requests it and, if any does so, only up to 30 days have elapsed from the delivery date. </li>
<li>Use of electric/electronic equipment is possible only if such equipment has its own source of power. A user of such equipment has to follow instructions of the library staff member. </li>
<li>Only the registered users or those with a one-day Admission Ticket may use reading rooms. If all seating places are occupied the user must leave the reading room. To reserve a chair for an absent user is not allowed. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="7"></a><br />External lending</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Only a registered user may take out library materials. That, given the nature of the collections, is rather exceptional. External loan without a deposit may be provided to a registered user above 18 years of age who permanently resides in the Czech Republic or who has a long-term resident permit. The National Library will conclude the loan contract only if the library unit is designated for such a use and there are no other serious obstacles to the conclusion. The registered user confirms conclusion of the loan contract by his signature conforming the specimen signature on the library card. </li>
<li>Registered user may have on loan a maximum of twenty library units at one time. </li>
<li>Lending period is usually 30 days unless stated otherwise. The renewal is possible to a maximum of 120 days and only if the item is not on reserve for another user.</li>
<li><span>A user is obliged to return the library unit either in person, or through a third party, or possibly to send it as an insured consignment by post, or to put it in the NL book return box (Bibliobox); the loan must always be returned before the end of the loan period. When the library unit is returned undamaged in time, the loan contract expires. If the library unit is returned by post or put in the NL book return box (Bibliobox), the loan contract expires after the condition of the library unit is physically checked and the unit is signed out from the reader´s account of the user.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="8"></a><br />Interlibrary, circulation and current awareness services </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The National Library would upon a request of a registered user acquire a library unit from another Czech library or from abroad if the requested unit is not in the National Library collections or is taken out of circulation. Through reciprocal service the National Library will lend its materials to any registered library in the Czech Republic for its registered users. Library units from Czech libraries collections are lent externally unless the borrowing library decides otherwise. Library units on loan from foreign libraries are for in-house use only. Amongst the libraries in the Czech Republic interlibrary services are free of charge. Photocopying is payable. International interlibrary services are charged for according to Fees and Services Price List. </li>
<li>External lending of individual issues of periodicals is rare, and only to other libraries and possibly to institutions. It is carried out through the National Library circulation service upon individually negotiated agreement. </li>
<li>Current awareness service is available to other libraries and possibly to institutions upon individually negotiated agreement. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="9"></a> <br />Grievances </strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="10"></a><br />Fees, reimbursements, deposits and guarantees</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Users and visitors are responsible for damages caused by breach of their legal responsibilities. Responsibility for damages is governed by the Civil Code. </li>
<li>In case that a registered user does not return the borrowed item in due time, he / she is obliged to pay a late fine, as agreed by the National Library of the CR and the registered user, persuant to § 2048 et seq. of the Civil Code as amended (hereinafter the late fine). The amount of the late fine is given in the NL of the CR Fees and Services Price List. The obligation to pay a late fine arises on the day that follows the end of the agreed loan period and it is counted for each borrowed item per calendar day of the delay until the obligation is fulfilled in accordance with the NL Rules and Regulations. </li>
<li>If a user does not return a library unit in due course he receives an overdue notice the cost of which will be charged to him. If the unit is not returned within one month from posting the overdue notice the National Library will enter litigation. There is a flat fee for the case preparatory steps and it is charged for each individual library unit (see the Fees and Services Price List). All cost of litigation is charged to the defendant. </li>

<li>The National Library may ask for a deposit on external loans to guarantee a return of borrowed library units. If the user does not comply with loan regulations the National Library will make use of the deposit to satisfy its claim for compensation of damages caused by user’s noncompliance and other appended charges according to these Rules and Regulations. If the deposit is lower than the cost of damages and other appended charges the claim of the National Library is sustained. </li>
<li><span>The user must report immediately any lost or damaged library unit to the National Library. The NL decides when and how the lost or damaged unit will be replaced. Preferably, the NL requires to obtain a duplicate of the unit in the same edition and binding.  If this is not possible or appropriate, the NL may ask for another edition of the unit or financial compensation. If agreed with a user, the NL may also accept another publication. The amount of financial compensation is governed by the current market price of the replaced unit or the price of the copy made, including the price for possible binding. The user shall also reimburse all costs incurred to the NL in connection with loss or damage of the library unit and its replacement. This does not relieve him /her from the obligation to pay overdue fine in the event of reporting the lost or damaged library unit after the loan period expired.</span></li>
